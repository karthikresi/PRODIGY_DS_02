## Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
# Overview
This task involves performing data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset to understand its structure, detect anomalies, and uncover patterns or trends. For this example, we will use the popular Titanic dataset from Kaggle, which contains information about the passengers aboard the Titanic and whether they survived or not. The goal is to explore the relationships between various variables (e.g., age, gender, fare, class) and to identify significant patterns and trends in the data.

# Objective
To perform data cleaning to handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
To conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to explore and visualize the relationships between variables.
To use Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.
To gain insights into the dataset and understand the factors that may have influenced survival on the Titanic.
Prerequisites
To complete this task, you need:

A dataset to analyze (e.g., the Titanic dataset from Kaggle).
Basic knowledge of Python and familiarity with the following libraries:
Pandas for data manipulation.
Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
NumPy for numerical computations.
# Steps
Load the Dataset: Import the dataset using Pandas and inspect its initial structure to understand the columns and data types.

# Data Cleaning:

Handle Missing Values: Identify and handle missing values using techniques like imputation, deletion, or interpolation.
Remove Duplicates: Check for and remove any duplicate rows to ensure data integrity.
Outlier Detection: Identify and handle outliers using statistical methods or domain knowledge.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Summary Statistics: Compute and interpret summary statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation) for numerical variables.
Data Visualization: Create visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, box plots, and bar charts to explore distributions and relationships between variables.
Correlation Analysis: Calculate the correlation matrix to identify relationships between numerical variables.
Feature Analysis: Analyze the impact of various features (e.g., age, gender, class) on the target variable (e.g., survival).
Interpret and Document Findings: Document insights from the EDA, such as significant patterns, correlations, or trends. Identify key factors that may have contributed to the target variable (e.g., survival).
